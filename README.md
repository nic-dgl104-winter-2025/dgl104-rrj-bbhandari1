### As developers, I encourage you to draw on programming knowledge when assessing apps. The first thing we tend to assess when critically examining an app is the interface and the UX. 
  Consider your programming knowledge when assessing apps: 
* Frameworks/libraries/APIs 
* Data structures 
* Platform-specific conventions

### User stories are a common tool employed in the design of user-facing systems 
* User stories are written in natural language from the perspective of the user 
* Typically written in the form: "As a user, I can " 
* User stories facilitate intra-team communication


### The downside of user stories is the lack of implementation details 
* Typically written without immediate consideration of technical constraints.  
* Issues related to technical considerations are sometimes overlooked (e.g. performance criteria). 
* User stories can be written with technical concerns in mind, but this may not be an ideal approach.

### A technical design document (TDD) is a written artefact that addresses technical concerns in a design context 
* Goal: Produce an unambiguous document detailing: 
* Architecture 
* Feature implementation 
* Testing plan 
* Performance criteria 
* There is no accepted standard for the development of TDDs. 
* TDDs can encompass a complete software design, or specific feature

### Functional requirements describe software features on an input/output basis 
* Just like 'functions' in programming (or in mathematics). 
* These may be included in a TDD, or related document. 
* Typically derived from user stories, or from use cases (a more technical-first approach to modeling systems).

### We can use the input/output approach to develop clear 'specifications' for our apps 
* Functional requirements and specifications are part of the standard software engineering toolkit.
* If our user story says: "as a forum user I can see posters' profile pictures as avatars", this might imply the following set of functional requirements: 
* Update profile: Enter required profile data (name, email) and optional profile data (profile pic, address, website, social accounts) -> return profile page with default content (e.g. default avatar) for incomple optional data.
